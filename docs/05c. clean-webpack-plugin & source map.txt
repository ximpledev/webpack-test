[CleanWebpackPlugin]

> npm start
it works (& runs in webpack-dev-server)
nothing added to dist/

> npm run build
it works,
but because we use [contenthash]

everytime the code is changed & rebuild,
a new app.*.bundle.js is created
that is,
there're more and more app.*.bundle.js in dist/

so we use CleanWebpackPlugin
to clean the dist/ for us

> npm i clean-webpack-plugin
(no -D cuz it's mainly used for prod)

- update webpack.prod.config.js
const {CleanWebpackPlugin} = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

plugins: [
  new CleanWebpackPlugin()
]

now
> npm run build
there's only one app.*.bundle.js in dist/

==========

[source map]

- update webpack.dev.config.js
devtool: 'source-map'
