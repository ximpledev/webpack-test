# Clean-Webpack Plugin

using
```
$ npm start
```
runs in `webpack-dev-server`\
& nothing added to `dist/`

\
using
```
$ npm run build
```
`webpack` builds stuff in `dist/`,\
& cuz we use `[contentHash]`\
everytime the code is changed & rebuild,\
a new `app.\*.bundle.js` is created\
that is,\
there're more and more `app.\*.bundle.js`\
in `dist/`\
so we use `clean-webpack-plugin`\
to clean the `dist/` for us

\
install `clean-webpack-plugin`
```
$ npm i clean-webpack-plugin
```
(no `-D` cuz it's used for `prod`)

\
update `webpack.prod.config.js`
```js
const {CleanWebpackPlugin} = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = merge(base, {
+ plugins: [
+   new CleanWebpackPlugin()
+ ]
});
```

\
then,\
run the `build` script
```
$ npm run build
```
there's only one `app.*.bundle.js`\
in `dist/`

# Source Map

update `webpack.dev.config.js`
```js
module.exports = merge(base, {
+ devtool: 'source-map'
});
```
