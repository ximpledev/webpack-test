# Webpack-Dev Server

in `package.json`\
instead of using `--watch`\
aka,
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack --config webpack.dev.config.js --watch"
  }
}
```

\
there's a better choice in `dev`\
=> using `webpack-dev-server`

\
because\
using `--watch`\
writes files\
(which we don't really need in `dev`)\
to `disk`

such as:\
`dist/bundle.js`\
(which is needed in `prod`, not in `dev`)

\
`webpack-dev-server`,\
which serves webpack bundles\
from `memory` (not from `disk`),\
automatically\
watches files & refreshes pages for us

\
so,\
using `webpack-dev-server`\
is better for `dev`

\
\
install `webpack-dev-server`
```
$ npm i -D webpack-dev-server
```

\
update `webpack.dev.config.js`
```js
module.exports = merge(base, {
+ devServer: {
+   contentBase: DIST_DIR,
+   stats: {
+     colors:  true,
+     reasons: true,
+     chunks:  false,
+     modules: false
+   }
+ }
});
```

<br>

> p.s.,\
devServer's `stats` are optional,\
but setting them\
makes the info (displayed in terminal)\
look better

<br>

update `package.json`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
-    "start": "webpack --config webpack.dev.config.js --watch",
+    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js"
  }
}
```

\
in addition,\
add param: `--open`\
aka,
```json
{
  "scripts": {
-    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js",
+    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js --open"
  }
}

```

which tells `devServer`\
 to open the browser\
after the server had been started

\
\
after updating\
all the code snippets above...

\
`package.json`'s `scripts`\
becomes
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js --open",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.config.js",
  }
},
```

<br>

finally,\
remove `dist/bundle.js`

\
& start running using
```
$ npm start
```
or
```
$ npm run build
```
to check\
if the results are correct
