[webpack-dev-server]

in package.json, instead of using "--watch"
that is,
"start": "webpack --config webpack.dev.config.js" --watch

there's a better choice
=> using webpack-dev-server...
why?

using --watch writes files to disk that we don't really need
such as: dist/bundle.js (which is needed in prod, not in dev)

webpack-dev-server, which serves webpack bundles from memory (not from disk),
automatically watches files and refreshes pages for us
so, using webpack-dev-server is better for dev

-----

> npm i -D webpack-dev-server

- update webpack.config.js
devServer: {
  contentBase: DIST_DIR
}

-----

webpack-dev-server has more options, but not necessary...

devServer: {
  contentBase: DIST_DIR,

  // Note:
  // 'inline': true is the default value, so ignore it for now and don't care
  // about what inline mode & iframe mode are.
  /*
  inline: true,
  */

  // Note:
  // When using the HTML5 History API, the index.html page will likely have to
  // be served in place of any 404 responses. Setting 'historyApiFallback' to
  // true enables this feature. But don't care about it for now cuz we haven't
  // used HTML5 History API yet.
  /*
  historyApiFallback: true,
  */

  // Note:
  // 'stats' here could be a string or an object. Use string if we want to get
  // minimal info; use object if we want to get more info.
  /*
  stats: 'errors-only'
  */
  stats: {
    colors:  true,
    reasons: true,
    chunks:  false,
    modules: false
  }
  // :Note
},

so, just use
devServer: {
  contentBase: DIST_DIR,
+ stats: {
+   colors:  true,
+   reasons: true,
+   chunks:  false,
+   modules: false
+ }
},

-----

- update package.json
"start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js",

- use --open
aka,
"start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js --open",
to tell dev-server to open the browser after server had been started

=>
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.config.js --open",
  "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.config.js",
  ...
},

from now on

for dev,
> npm start
to use webpack-dev-server and no 'dist' folder is built

for prod,
> npm run build
to use webpack to build stuff in 'dist' folder

-----

- remove dist/bundle.js

> npm start

cuz we add --open at the end of the 'start' script
http://localhost:8080/
will be opened automatically
