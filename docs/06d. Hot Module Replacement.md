HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

- update webpack.config.js

devServer: {
  ...
  hot: true
},

plugins: [
  ...
  new new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()
]

p.s.,
if we want to use [chunkhash] later,
HMR must be disabled, or compilation will fail.

p.s.,
it's OK to use [hash/contenthash] when HMR is enabled.

p.s.,
[hash] is used by file-loader
[contenthash] is used by extract-text-plugin

p.s.,
cuz using HMR makes [chunkhash] useless and I possibly want to use [chunkhash],
plus HMR is a bit complicated to set up,
so I prefer not to use HMR

p.s.,
to me, using webpack-dev-server,
which automatically watches files and refreshes pages for us,
is good enough for developing

and, for production,
it's OK to use webpack without watching
cuz we just use it to create some files in /dist
